Gitpod is an on-demand developer environment for a GitHub, Git, or BitBucket workspace. It's super easy to use, offers 50 hours of free use per month, and only requires a chromium based browser.

Using Gitpod, you can run the notebook files in an on-demand VS Code, browser based environment. 😎

## New to Github and Gitpod? Here's how to start...
